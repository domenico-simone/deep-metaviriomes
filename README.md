## Host prediction of viral contigs

Throughout the paper, publicly available software was used to perform most analyses. However, prediction of potential hosts for viral contigs included a lot of data processing with custom scripts. The main purpose of this repo is to describe this analysis. The protocol for this prediction analysis can be found at the following link:
